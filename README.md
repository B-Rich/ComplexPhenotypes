# Searchable ComplexPhenotypes
*Searchable database of sequencing and phenotype data*
## Intro
The Complex Phenotypes database is a relational database that enables users to find what data sets are available for download based on the phenotype and type of data they are interested in from NCBI's [Sequence Read Archive] (https:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and [Genotypes and Phenotypes] (https/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) databases. These are the largest public repositories of phenotpye and sequencing data. However, currently finding data of interest by phenotype is challenging. Searchable Complex Phenotypes is a way to make metadata more easily accessible.

This repository contains a R package that allows you access all pulic metadata to explore what data is available. You can do this in two ways. One is to the query the database in R and second is to use a shiny app to query the database.
