# Searchable ComplexPhenotypes
*Searchable database of sequencing and phenotype data*

The Complex Phenotypes database is a relational database that enables users to find what data sets are available for download based on the phenotype and type of data they are interested in from NCBI's [Sequence Read Archive] (https:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and [Genotypes and Phenotypes] (https/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) databases.

This repository contains a R package that allows you access all pulic metadata from dbGaP, which will include study level information from dbGaAP as well as sample information from SRA. You can explore what data  is available in two ways. One is to the query the database in R and second is to use a shiny app to query the database.
